BitHD Frozen Armor can be purchased at <a href="https://bithd.com/Frozen-Armor.html">bithd.com</a>. It claims "Indestructible Robustness" and to be fireproof:
304 stainless steel: 2624℉.
Aviation aluminum alloy: 1220℉.
Claims "Corrosion Resistant" - Saline-alkaline tolerant; acid & rust proof.

## Setup

This has the tiniest screws I've seen yet - it's quite frustrating to handle them. The tiles are nice and thick though, I found it easy to push them out of the template in which they are shipped.

## Heat Stress Test

Seemed to be doing fine for 6 minutes and then it started collapsing so I immersed it in water. Catastrophic failure. Upon looking back at their web site, apparently only the tiles are stainless steel - the casing is aluminum, which melts at common house fire temperatures!

## Corrosion Stress Test

Still sizzling - I'm sure that if the acid hadn't been used up, it would have completely disintegrated.

## Crush Stress Test

There wasn't enough of the device left to bother crushing it, though we know that aluminum is a fairly malleable metal so I wouldn't have expected it to survive.
