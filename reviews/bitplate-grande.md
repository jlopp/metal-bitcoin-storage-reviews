Bitplate Domino Grande can be purchased at <a href="https://www.bitplates.com/">bitplates.com</a>. BitPLATES® Marine-grade range of Domino® are made from 316L stainless steel, not just 316 stainless steel, because 316L has a lower carbon content, which provides an even greater level of intergranular corrosion-resistance under saltwater conditions; especially important, following the stress of surface deformation caused by multiple dots indented onto the surface of the metal. Bitplates claims a melting point up to 1399 °C or 2550 °F.

## Setup

Setup was straightforward; it only takes a few minutes to set up. Unfortunately it looks like I neglected to take a photo right after punching my plate.
