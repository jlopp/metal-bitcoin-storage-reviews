Bitplate Domino can be purchased at <a href="https://www.bitplates.com/">bitplates.com</a>. BitPLATES® Marine-grade range of Domino® are made from 316L stainless steel, not just 316 stainless steel, because 316L has a lower carbon content, which provides an even greater level of intergranular corrosion-resistance under saltwater conditions; especially important, following the stress of surface deformation caused by multiple dots indented onto the surface of the metal. Bitplates claims a melting point up to 1399 °C or 2550 °F.

## Setup

I find center punch style storage to be far easier to set up than letter stamping or engraving. The domino is novel in that it's more compact than other plates that use one square per letter. It's pretty easy to encode 2 letters per square via a "1 dot" and "2 dots" system. Since I just coded the plate with "HODL HODL HODL..." I ended up having 3 dots in every square I used.
