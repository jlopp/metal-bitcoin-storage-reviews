Black Seed Ink can be purchased at <a href="https://blackseedink.com/">blackseedink.com/</a>. They tout the following characteristics:
<ul>
	<li>.8mm thick 304 grade stainless steel</li>
	<li>Matte black finish - protection against rust and corrosion</li>
	<li>Raised steel guidelines - easy etching</li>
	<li>Etching tool - tungsten carbide fine tip and knurled grip</li>
	<li>Canadian manufactured Chicago screws plus nylon washers</li>
</ul>

## Setup

This device comes with an etching pen; on one side I did some really deep etches while on the other side I made some lighter etches. I'd rate this as easier to set up than stamping or etching with a dremel, though I still prefer center punching.

## Heat Stress Test

No data loss. I did note that the nylon washers burned off. Not sure why they went with nylon...

## Corrosion Stress Test

The lighter etched words are getting pretty faint but are still legible at the right angle.

## Crush Stress Test

On the verge of data loss, but you can still make out the words.
