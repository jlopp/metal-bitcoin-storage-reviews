Coldbit Steel can be purchased at <a href="https://coldbit.com/product/coldbit-steel/">coldbit.com</a>. It's constructed of a 4mm thick stainless steel plate, a 2mm thick stainless steel cover, and 2 nickel binding posts. It's designed to withstand house fires, flood, electrical shock, extreme temperatures (up to 2192°F / 1200°C) and humidity. Nice touches are that the Coldbit Steel came with a stamping plate, ear plugs, and the Coldbit Passphrase hex rod.


## Setup

It was nice that this came with a stamping plate, though I felt like the stamping plate I bought for $5 on Amazon was far superior.

## Heat Stress Test

Discoloration but no data loss.

## Corrosion Stress Test

No data loss; even the freehand etchings were legible.
