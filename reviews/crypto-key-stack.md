Crypto Key Stack can no longer be purchased at cryptokeystack.com. The black anodized stainless steel plates offer fire protection up to 2,200°F — well above the temperature of a house fire. Also claims to be waterproof and rustproof. Comes with its own engraver.

## Setup

You can either engrave or stamp your seeds onto these stainless steel cards. Engraving was pretty easy, though the granularity of the engraver leaves a bit to be desired — it would be easy to screw up a letter in a way that makes it ambiguous to read, such as a B versus an 8 or 1 versus l.

## Heat Stress Test

The screw near the heat deformed slightly and was very hard to unscrew, but I managed to loosen it with pliers. I really don’t like how small the heads on the screws are; I think products like this should use pretty heavy duty hardware.

## Corrosion Stress Test

The acid removed some of the black anodization from the outer plates, but the inner plates were completely unaffected.

## Crush Stress Test

Performed admirably under pressure; after prying the layers back apart I was still able to read all of the data off them.
