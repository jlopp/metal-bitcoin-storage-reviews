## Setup

Pretty simple - a dozen pieces of steel, but from experience running these tests simple is good. Major bonus points that they ship with a 3D printed stamp holder. FYI it's not advisable to try to stamp the pieces while they're still on the key ring; they need to be completely flat on the stamping surface.

## Crush Stress Test

It was no surprise that the pieces bent under pressure - you can actually bend them by hand if you try hard enough. However, the steel pieces would need to be completely torn apart in order to cause data loss.
