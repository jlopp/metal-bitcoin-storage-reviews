## Setup

Setup was easy as expected.

## Heat Stress Test

Zeus is pretty much the same body as Thor (which I tested years ago) and it performed admirably.

One thing I particularly appreciate about CyptoTag is their fastener system. Unlike the many products that use screws, the slide-on fasteners that CryptoTag users are very easy to pry off with a simple flathead screwdriver even if device deformation occurs.

## Corrosion Stress Test

Somewhat concerning because you can see some parts of the template are fading. The data and template are still legible, though it would take a bit of work to recover this data. CryptoTag might want to take another look at how they are etching the template onto this device.

## Crush Stress Test

No data loss. Would still require some work to decode the data from parts where the template is missing.
