Cryptovault can be purchased at <a href="https://protectingcoin.com/product/protectingcoin-cryptovault/">protectingcoin.com</a>. Claims to be fire-proof, water-proof, rust-proof, wind-proof, electric-proof, EMP-proof, drop-proof, spilled coffee-proof, pet-proof, baby-proof, demon-proof and acid resistant. It reminds me of the ColdTi in terms of side and feel. The one-way wire security cables with serial numbers are an unique touch that provides tamper evidence.

## Setup

This was easy enough to etch but it clearly not designed for stamping, perhaps because the metal is too hard — every other time I’d strike a stamping bit against the plate, the bit would fly out of my hand and across the room.

## Heat Stress Test

No data loss, though the freehand etched words are hard to read.

## Corrosion Stress Test

Experienced some data loss, mainly of the freehand etched words.
