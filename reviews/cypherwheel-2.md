## Setup

This is a unique device for sure; you can see a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5EjHHiKQwM">video of the setup process here</a>. While you have to slide the tiles along rails, the rail system is very different from the cryptosteel style. The tolerances on Cypherwheel are much lower, which is a good thing in my opinion as it means tiles are less likely to move around. The downside is that it takes a lot more effort to get them into place. Expect 1 to 2 minutes per 4 letter word, meaning it can easily take you an hour to fill the whole wheel. One neat feature is that each word has its own one-way "lock" that can't be undone once you've pushed it into place. I recall struggling with the setup of my last Cypherwheel due to the low tolerances, but this once seemed to be a bit easier to get the tiles into.

## Heat Stress Test

I noticed it retains FAR more heat than any of the other devices, perhaps due to sheer metal mass and surface area. Most devices finished cooling off in the water after 5 or 10 seconds. The Cypherwheel took over 30 seconds. I do believe that the extreme cooling resulted in most of the deformation that occurred - I didn't notice any while it was still hot.

You may recall that my heat test of the previous version caused it to deform enough that I couldn't rotate the wheel. Unlike last time, I was still able to rotate the wheel by hand with this iteration. It took a little more effort than when it was in pristine condition, but it's clearly still usable.

## Corrosion Stress Test

Unlike the last version I tested, the acid did not dissolve the hub around which the wheels rotate, thus the device remained intact. No data loss.

## Crush Stress Test

I crushed the device and was only able to get a few mm of deformation, though it was enough to make the top plate not spin freely. I was able to still rotate the back plate freely and noticed that a few of the words had the last tile fall out, presumably because the deformation loosened up the "lock" that you punch in.
