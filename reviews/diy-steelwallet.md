You can learn about the SteelWallet project on <a href="https://github.com/thephijo/DIY_SteelWallet">github</a>. This project is unique in that it includes 3D printable templates for enclosures and tamper evident locks. It doesn't make any durability claims.

## Setup

I tried both stamping and dremel etching on the titanium and the steel plates. Etching seems to be the way to go.
