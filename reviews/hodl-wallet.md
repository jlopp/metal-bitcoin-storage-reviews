The HODL Wallet is no longer available at thehodlwallet.com. Looks to be a clone of the Billfodl / CryptoSteel. Claims "made from AISI 316 stainless steel, the HODL wallet is fireproof, waterproof, shockproof, corrosion resistant, and astonishingly strong."

## Setup

The slightly annoying thing is that the tiles come in cardboard compartments, but the plastic wrap around the cardboard isn’t tight enough to keep the tiles in their original compartments. As such, it’s no better organized than a bag of loose tiles.

## Heat Stress Test

No data loss; tiles remained in place.

## Corrosion Stress Test

All of the rivets dissolved and thus the stacks of rails fell apart, resulting in all of the tiles falling out. Catastrophic data loss.

## Crush Stress Test

Already destroyed, but we know from test of the Cryptosteel Cassette that the tiles would fall out after the device was crushed and pried back open.
