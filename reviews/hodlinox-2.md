Hodlinox can be purchased at <a href="https://hodlinox.com/">hodlinox.com</a>. This is the third Hodlinox product I've tested. This is basically the second iteration of the first dual-plate product I tested several years ago. The main difference is that this generation has interlocking plates on both ends. Claims to be:
<ul>
	<li>Material: stainless steel 316</li>
	<li>Melting point: 1460 ℃ / 2642 ℉.</li>
</ul>

## Setup

I dremel etched a couple words because this product is designed for engraving rather than stamping. Looks like I forgot to take a photo of it open after engraving.

## Heat Stress Test

No data loss.

## Corrosion Stress Test

No data loss.

## Crush Stress Test

Due to the nature of the interlocking plates, when you warp the device and crush it... the plates becomes inseparable. So I had to warp them back in the other direction to open it.

Upon inspection we can see that no data was lost.
