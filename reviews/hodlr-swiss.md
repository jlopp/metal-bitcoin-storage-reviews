## Setup

This center punch takes some getting used to because instead of putting divots in empty squares you're punching them on top of raised letters. At a glance it's not as easy to tell what letters are encoded.

## Crush Stress Test

My hydraulic press was unable to visibly deform the HODLR Swiss. Unfortunately, my crush test managed to completely lock up this device. It's no longer possible for me to rotate the disks in order to unscrew the outer ring. I'm 100% confident that the data inside is still intact, but I don't have the tools necessary to access it.
