## Heat Stress Test

It was a bit annoying to open this device as the heat had deformed it and I couldn't unscrew all of the bolts. I ended up having to clamp the plates together in order to relieve enough pressure to unscrew them.

Once I opened the device, it was clear there was no data loss.

## Crush Stress Test

Warping can also make it pretty tough to actually unscrew the bolts.
