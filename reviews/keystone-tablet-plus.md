Keystone Tablet Plus can be purchased at <a href="https://shop.keyst.one/products/keystone-tablet-plus">keysto.one</a>. The successor of the Cobo Tablet I tested a year prior - that product didn't perform well. Keystone Tablet Plus is redesigned with a slot for each letter tile, as opposed to a slot for every four. It has 13 screws on each side to better hold all the letter tiles, as opposed to 3 screws on each side for Keystone Tablet. Keystone makes the following claims:

<ul>
	<li>Composed entirely of 304-grade stainless steel</li>
	<li>Fireproof threshold of 1399 to 1455°C / 2550 to 2651°F</li>
	<li>Waterproof</li>
	<li>Corrosion Resistant</li>
</ul>

## Setup

Tile based systems like this are very convenient to set up, though fiddling with all the tiny screws can be a bit annoying.

## Heat Stress Test

Unfortunately, the additional screws that have been added to this device still don't seem to be enough to prevent the slots from expanding and thus losing tiles. I have to consider this to be catastrophic data loss.

## Corrosion Stress Test

No additional data loss than seen after the heat test.

## Crush Stress Test

Most tile based devices tend to let all the tiles fall out when you warp the device. Surprisingly, this did not happen with the Keystone Tablet Plus. It looks like the additional screws come in handy after all.
