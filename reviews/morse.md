The Morse can be purchased at <a href="https://www.themorse.net/">themorse.net</a>. At time of writing, it makes no durability claims.

## Setup

Using the center punch for the initial indentation is easy, but the hand drill is a real strain. Highly recommend using a power drill instead for deepening the dots.

## Heat Stress Test

After 6 minutes of heat, The Morse lost structural integrity and separated into two pieces. Catastrophic failure.

## Corrosion Stress Test

No discernible difference after being exposed to acid.

## Crush Stress Test

After only a few tons of pressure applied, The Morse lost structural integrity and broke in half again. Catastrophic failure.

So we can see that The Morse is not particularly durable against heat or pressure. It's unclear what it's made out of, but it's clearly no stainless steel.
