## Setup

GRAPHENE is unique in the sense that it comes with a unique template meant to provide additional security against physical attackers who find the plate. The idea is that you store the template and the plate in two separate locations, essentially creating a 2-of-2 backup. In the case that you lose the template, it comes with a unique code you can use to request a replacement from NGRAVE.

## Heat Stress Test

No data loss, just some expected warping of the sheet due to its size and thinness.

## Corrosion Stress Test

No data loss.

## Crush Stress Test

No data loss. Given that the template is required to decode the data, it's worth noting that sufficient deformation means that in order to read the data you'll need to reverse the deformities so that the template can be laid flat against the data plate. Or try to deform the template to match the data plate...
