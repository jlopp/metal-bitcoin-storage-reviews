The Quadrat Register 11 can be purchased at <a href="https://qreg.tech/">qreg.tech</a>. This is a new product from the company that produced one of the <a href="https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/reviews/quadrat-register/">best performing devices to date</a>; the Quadrat Register P. The P version was more complex with a lot of loose parts while this version is a much simpler "sandwich." They don't make durability claims.

## Setup

This device has a novel encoding system. Novelty can be bad; if you're trying to recover data and don't know how to decode it, you're gonna have a bad time. I ran it by a Bitcoiner who is less technical and they were not a fan.

Actually setting up the device is a bit trickier than a center punch; qreq provides a tool to punch out the squares from the plate. Once you get the hang of it, it takes 5 to 10 seconds per square.

## Heat Stress Test

I had a really hard time reopening this device. In fact, the supplied wrench sheared off and I had to go find a sturdier wrench with a security star head. Some commenters have said this could be a result of using titanium screws in titanium plates. "Titanium galls with itself and steel fasteners will galvanically corrode over time if mixed with titanium. It's a dilemma."

That said, once I got the device open it was in pristine condition.

## Corrosion Stress Test

No data loss.

## Crush Stress Test

Similar to the original Quadrat Register cylinder, my press was unable to visibly deform this device. No data loss.
