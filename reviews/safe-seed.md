Safe Seed can be purchased at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Safe-Seed-Recovery-Passphrase-CryptoCurrency/dp/B07CLMK3WJ">amazon.com</a>. It makes no durability claims.

## Setup

Not much to say; it's a copper sheet. At $16 this is the cheapest of all the devices ever tested, so it will be interesting to see how it performs.

## Heat Stress Test

While there was some discoloration of the device, both engraved and stamped words are still legible. Note that I didn't fill the whole device with words in order to minimize my time spent doing so.

## Corrosion Stress Test

No data loss.

## Crush Stress Test

It's hard to tell from the photo but the engraved words are still faintly legible. No data loss.
