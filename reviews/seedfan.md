## Setup

Setup was straightforward. NOTE: the engraver pen that comes with the kit is very low powered. So much so that if I pressed down hard enough, it locked up. And I was using fresh batteries. I'd recommend buying a plug-in engraver with more power so that you can etch more deeply into the plate. However, it doesn't seem strictly necessary given how well the data held up from only the battery powered engraver.

## Heat Stress Test

Seedfan takes the heat like a champ.

The only issue I had was that the small screws seized up after the heat test and I had to destroy them in order to separate the plates again.

## Corrosion Stress Test

No data loss.

## Crush Stress Test

No data loss; quite legible.
