Seedplate can be purchased at <a href="https://bitcoinseedbackup.com/">bitcoinseedbackup.com</a>. It doesn't appear to make any claims about durability.

## Setup

As usual, the straight punch method is one I find to be fastest and most user friendly.

## Heat Stress Test

As expected, only some discoloration - no data loss.

## Corrosion Stress Test

Unaffected by the acid.

## Crush Stress Test

Extremely robust; you can see the diamond outline of where I tried to bend it. Even 20 tons of force only managed to deform it a few millimeters.
