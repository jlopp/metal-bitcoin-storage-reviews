SeedSteel is no longer available; it used to be sold at seedsteel.com. It looks pretty rudimentary — two thin steel plates sandwiched between two really thick steel plates. Came with a center punch to write words as dots, which was odd.

## Setup

Not much to say here — it’s two sheets of metal sandwiched between two thicker sheets of metal. No problems with etching or stamping.

## Heat Stress Test

Lots of discoloration on the interior metal sheets, but still quite readable.

## Corrosion Stress Test

No data loss of any of the writing types.

## Crush Stress Test
