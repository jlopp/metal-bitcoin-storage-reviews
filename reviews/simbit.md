Simbit can be purchased at <a href="https://www.simbit.com/">simbit.com</a>. This is a tile-based design but is not based upon CryptoSteel like all the others I’ve tested. Its web site states that "<i>Simbit's materials are rated to survive prolonged exposure to temperatures of up to 1700°F / 925°C. That's 600°F hotter than a typical house fire. Simbit is constructed entirely in 316 marine grade stainless steel alloy, providing superior corrosion resistance to more common stainless steels</i>."

## Setup

The tiles were nicely organized on a single metal sheet that you pried them off off, but they are so tiny it's really annoying to actually work with them. Simbit provides an "assembly tool" which is a small sliver of metal that you're supposed to attach putty on the end to get the tiles to stick onto, but I found this so annoying to deal with that I just resorted to my fingers and a tiny screwdriver to guide the tiles along the rails.

## Heat Stress Test

No data loss.

## Corrosion Stress Test

Surprisingly survive the corrosion test, which few tile-based devices do — hard to read but still legible.

## Crush Stress Test

Surprisingly, no data loss! This was the only tile-based device to survive all of the stress tests. I suspect that this is due to how thin the tiles are and how tightly they fit in the rails — as such, when there was expansion / contraction / movement of the metal, all of the pieces remained together.
