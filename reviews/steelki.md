SteelKi is available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelKi-Metal-Crypto-Backup-Engraver/dp/B07TJKXC3P/ref=sr_1_3">Amazon.</a> It doesn't appear to make any durability claims.

## Setup

Extremely straightforward; it only takes a few minutes to engrave the words by hand. They're highly legible due to the black varnish that covers the plate.

## Heat Stress Test

The black coating didn't even last 30 seconds under the flame; don't rely upon it for high visibility after a fire. It's hard to see from the photos but the etching is still slightly visible at the right angles - no data loss, but not great. I'm less confident in this hand etching than in the electrochemical etching or stamping methods.

## Corrosion Stress Test

It seems like the words are MORE visible now...

## Crush Stress Test

Bent but no data loss.
