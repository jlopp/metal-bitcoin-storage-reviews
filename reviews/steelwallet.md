Steelwallet can be purchased at <a href="https://www.blockark.de/steelwallet/">blockark.de</a>. This is the same center punch style as Blockplate but slightly smaller and a fraction of a millimeter thicker. Appears to be by the Shift Crypto team, creators of the BitBox hardware wallet. Claims to protect "against fire, water, electrical-shocks, corrosion and pretty much any obstacles nature throws at it."

## Setup

Using the center punch went smoothly and quickly.
