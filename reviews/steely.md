The Steely can be purchased at <a href="https://thesteely.com/collections/steely-cold-storage-kits/products/steely-cryptocurrency-cold-storage">thesteely.com</a>. Claims to be constructed from 304 Stainless Steel, fireproof up to 1200ºC / 2200ºF, waterproof. corrosion resistant, and rustproof.

## Setup

I appreciate that the tiles come already separated into individual plastic containers. Assembly was straightforward and required no tools. The sliding shutter feature is unique though we'll see if it's actually functional.

## Heat Stress Test

It took less than 2 minutes of applied heat before a dozen tiles fell out. The fancy looking shutters on the front didn't help with the structural integrity; the cover and rails expanded sufficiently that the tiles fell right through the middle of the device. Upon being immersed in the water bucket, another 3 dozen tiles fell out. Catastrophic failure.

## Corrosion Stress Test

Hard to tell if there was additional data loss due to acid, but doesn't look like it.

## Crush Stress Test

Another catastrophic failure for rail-based devices.
