The Tjernlund CC3p can be purchased at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tjernlund-Cryptocurrency-Indestructible-Storage-Safekeeping/dp/B07B7R5FCR/">Amazon</a>. Manufactured in entirely in the USA by Tjernlund, a 80-year-old family run sheet metal manufacturer. The CC3P is basically a few cut pieces of commercial grade 304 Stainless Steel. Tjernlund claims to be:

<ul>
	<li>Waterproof</li>
	<li>Fireproof</li>
	<li>Drop-proof</li>
	<li>Corrosion-proof</li>
	<li>Shock-proof</li>
</ul>

However, it also claims:

"with its three piece, single fit design you can now add a new layer of security: geographic security. Simply by locating each 1/3 of your device in different locations you remove the value and motivation of finding a single piece and exponentially increase the difficulty of your information being compromised."

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that splitting your seed in this manner is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5nSibpfHYE">actually a bad idea</a>.

## Setup

The layout of this plate is a bit odd because it claims to be for 24 words, but two of the sets of 3 lines are right on top of the physical breaks, so you can't really stamp any words there.

## Heat Stress Test

Lots of discoloration but no data loss.

## Corrosion Stress Test

The acid seems to have cleared off some of the discoloration from the heat testing, but no effects upon the legibility of the stamped words.

## Crush Stress Test

The plates bent a fair amount but experienced no data loss.
