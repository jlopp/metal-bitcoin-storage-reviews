## Setup

Setup was aided by the provided jig for the stamps. However, unlike the metal jigs provided by some companies, this jig was 3D printed plastic. Unfortunately, after several dozen strikes, I had a mis-hit and the jig shattered. I'd highly recommend VaultKi redesign the jig to be a more durable material.

## Heat Stress Test

VaultKi handles heat quite nicely.

I was afraid the screw mechanism might seize up, but I had no trouble opening it by hand once it cooled down.

## Corrosion Stress Test

AAlthough I did notice some slight bubbling from the device when it was submerged in acid, there was no discernible degradation even after 12 hours.

## Crush Stress Test

As expected, like most other tube devices I've tested, it does deform under 20 tons of pressure.

And similar to other tube devices, the problem that occurs after pressure deformation is that you can no longer open the device.

Now, you could actually consider this to be a feature. If the device is not openable by hand, it's highly unlikely that someone sifting through debris such as a firefighter is going to pick up and pocket a nondescript metal tube and then find the heavy tooling required to split it open. This provides a bit of security through obscurity.
